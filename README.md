Lotto Number Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predicting lottery numbers may seem impossible, but this project uses machine learning techniques to find patterns in past lotto data. The goal is to predict future winning numbers based on historical patterns, using models to analyze number frequency, combinations, and trends.

🔹 Workflow Overview
📌 Understand the Problem → 📌 Collect and Clean Data → 📌 Feature Selection → 📌 Model Training → 📌 Evaluation → 📌 Deployment

🔹 Key Steps in the Project
✅ Data Collection – Gathered past lottery draw results, including winning numbers and draw dates.
✅ Data Cleaning – Cleaned data by handling missing values and ensuring proper format for analysis.
✅ Feature Selection – Chose features like number frequency, previous winning combinations, and time trends.
✅ Model Training – Applied machine learning algorithms (like decision trees or neural networks) to identify patterns and predict future numbers.
✅ Evaluation – Measured model accuracy using metrics such as error rates and prediction success.
✅ Deployment – Developed a tool that generates potential winning number predictions based on the trained model.
